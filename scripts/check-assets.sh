# Per-pack asset licence tracking.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF check-licenses.sh. That script scans vendored SOURCE
# files for SPDX headers — first-party code with a declared licence. An asset
# pack is neither: it is third-party art with its own licence file, shipped
# unchanged, and a GPL pack sitting in an MIT repository contaminates it. So the
# two are tracked separately, per plan §14 and §17.7, and never inferred from
# one another.
#
# TWO RULES, and the second is the one that matters.
#
#   1. Every directory under apps/web/public/assets/ ships a LICENSE.txt. This
#      runs on every merge rather than at selection time, so a pack added
#      without one is caught here rather than at some later audit.
#   2. The licence RECORDED IN THE SHORTLIST matches the text actually shipped
#      beside that pack.
#
# Rule 2 is the one with teeth. A pack relicensed upstream between selection and
# merge still has a LICENSE.txt, so rule 1 passes, and the shortlist goes on
# asserting something untrue — which is the failure a file merely existing cannot
# see. Verification means the shipped text says what the table says.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK: whether the packs look like one game.
# Plan §14 makes style consistency the actual selection criterion, and no script
# can judge it. A "style lint" would claim to check something it cannot and would
# be trusted. The shortlist declares a style per row so a human can review the
# claim; this script checks the part that is mechanical and that people actually
# get wrong.

# Matched on distinctive PHRASES, not on a licence's abbreviation — and that is a
# correction, not a style choice. The first version grepped for CC0|MIT|APACHE|
# GPL|LGPL|MPL|BSD, and "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3" contains NO contiguous
# "GPL": the letters are spread across three words. So replacing a pack's shipped
# licence with GPL passed the mismatch check, which is the exact failure the rule
# exists to catch. A check whose keywords have to be spelled a particular way is
# a check that misses the common case.
#
# Ordered so a longer name is tested before a shorter one it contains: LGPL
# contains "GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE", and MPL's file mentions Apache, so the
# wrong-first ordering would classify a copyleft pack as the permissive one.

# THE ROW COUNT IS A FLOOR THAT IS NOT YET FATAL, and the distinction is

#
# The licence rules above are per-merge properties with teeth: a pack merged
# without a licence, or with a licence that contradicts the table, is a defect
# that should stop the merge. The count is not — it is the state of a SELECTION
# that has not been made yet, and §14 makes style consistency the actual
# criterion with no script able to judge it.
#
# So it WARNS rather than failing. A gate that is red on a known-incomplete
# selection trains people to ignore it, and the rules above would go with it. The
# floor becomes fatal when the selection lands, and not before: pad the table to
# reach it and the criterion this whole script serves — style, not count — is
# satisfied in form and failed in substance. §14 is explicit that a shortlist of
# 20 packs in five visual styles is worse than 12 in one.
