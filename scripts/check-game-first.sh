# The game-first gate. Section 1 and section 2 of
# docs/design/game-first-doctrine.md, checked mechanically.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A NOTE
#
# Every rule here has already been broken in this repository, and each one broke
# in a way that read as normal at the time:
#
#   - three routes under a shared dashboard layout, which is a textbook Next.js
#     pattern and was the shape of the whole application for a day;
#   - a sign-in gate on a landing page, which is a security feature, not a
#     layout decision, and looked nothing like one;
#   - 3,436 licensed art files on disk referenced only from comments, which
#     passed every test in the repository.
#
# A note about the right shape does not stop the wrong shape, because the wrong
# shape is assembled out of right-shaped pieces. So each rule below is a grep,
# and each one is written to fail on a REGRESSION rather than to describe a
# property.

  # cannot tell a comment from a call -- and a comment is not a load. Two packs
