# Canonical M0 test pipeline — plan section 40.
#
#   The stage set is NOT listed here. scripts/stages.manifest is the single
#   definition, and the preflight below fails if this file's CANONICAL_STAGES or
#   the run_stage dispatch disagree with it. An earlier version of this header
#   enumerated the stages in prose and went stale at eight of them, which the
#   three-way check cannot catch: all three real views agreed while only the
#   sentence was wrong.
#
# Contributors run this file directly through `pnpm test:m0`; CI runs this same
# file as the command of the compose `m0-test-runner` service. Same file, same
# stage order, same exit code in both places — that is the whole point of the
# local/CI parity contract.
#
# Guarantees this script is responsible for:
#   - stages execute in the order above, never out of order;
#   - every executed stage writes a marker under `.tmp/m0-stages/`, and a run may
#     only report the M0 gate green when a marker exists for every stage in the
#     manifest, so
#     no stage can be skipped silently;
#   - a red stage names itself in the summary, in the stderr verdict, and in the
#     exit code.
#
# A stage whose implementation does not exist in this tree yet is reported as
# `unimplemented` and fails the run. That is deliberate: a missing stage and a
# passing stage must never look the same.
