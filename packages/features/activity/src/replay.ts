/**
 * The public replay: a battle's timeline, projected for somebody who is not
 * logged in.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN THE ACTIVITY FEATURE, which is the decision a reader will
 * look for first. A replay is not a lifecycle: it has no capability, no action,
 * no handler and nothing to write. It is a projection of the log this feature
 * owns, and it depends on the log's ordering, on the log's retention window and
 * on the log's guarantee that a row's fields are unbounded strings. A second
 * package holding that projection would have to redeclare the read port — the
 * layering rules stop features importing each other, so it could not ask — and
 * the two answers would then be free to disagree about what happened first and
 * how long a log row survives. That disagreement is the failure this feature's
 * own header exists to prevent, so the projection is here rather than beside it.
 *
 * WHY THE ALLOW-LIST IS A PROJECTION AND NOT A FILTER, which is the whole
 * shape of this file. `docs/design/public-event-stream.md` settled the
 * argument for the live stream and it applies verbatim here: in
 * `packages/protocol/src/agent-event.ts` every payload field is
 * `z.string().min(1)`, so `test.failed.failure`, `test.passed.suite` and every
 * other string in the log is an arbitrary string of arbitrary length. An event
 * cannot be published and then have its dangerous field removed, because nothing
 * in the type says which field was the dangerous one. So every beat below is
 * BUILT here, field by field, from a closed list, and an event with nothing
 * publishable in it produces no beat at all rather than an empty one.
 *
 * THE PUBLIC BOUNDARY, in one paragraph, because the plan does not spell it out
 * and a reader should not have to reverse it out of a table. A logged-out viewer
 * sees WHICH HARNESSES competed, WHEN each step happened, and HOW THE RUBRIC
 * SCORED — and sees nothing about WHO they are or WHAT they were working on. No
 * agent id, no session id, no repository, no issue number, no bounty id, no
 * prompt, no file path, no command, no reasoning. The reason is that a replay
 * link is permanent and public while everything in that list is either an
 * internal handle that would let a reader bridge a public page to an
 * authenticated surface, or a pointer to somebody's private work. The harness is
 * the exception because it names a TOOL rather than a person, it is drawn from a
 * closed enum the protocol already defines, and "claude versus codex" is the
 * whole reason a stranger would click the link. `docs/design/public-replay.md`
 * is the long form.
