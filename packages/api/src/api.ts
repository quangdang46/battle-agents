/**
 * The application API: the single definition of what an agent can do.
 *
 * CLI, HTTP and MCP are three consumers of this and nothing else. They are
 * adapters over the same five primitives, so a feature is reachable from all
 * three because the three of them reach the same place — not because somebody
 * remembered to add it to each.
 *
 * The surface is frozen at five. The pressure to add a sixth, or to promote one
 * domain operation to a first-class tool because somebody asked for it, arrives
 * early and repeatedly; the answer is that the operation already exists in the
 * registry and promoting it means every later feature will ask the same. The
 * primitives grow the game's reach without growing what a client has to read.
