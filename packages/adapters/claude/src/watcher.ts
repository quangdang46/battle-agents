/**
 * Both planes, one buffer, one stream.
 *
 * The hook plane pushes in as it happens; the JSONL tail polls for whatever the
 * hooks missed. They share a buffer so the batching policy is the one the
 * ingest endpoint actually accepts — 250ms or 50 events, well short of the
 * 100-event refusal — and an adapter that invented a second policy would be
 * refused by the very endpoint it is posting to.
 *
 * The dedup ledger is the seam between them, and it belongs here rather than in
 * either plane. The hook plane records what it emitted; the tail asks whether
 * the line it just read was already reported. Deciding that inside the parser
 * would make the same transcript line correct in one deployment and a
 * duplicate in another depending on whether hooks were healthy, and the policy
 * would be unreachable from a test.
 *
 * The tail wins ties in the other direction: when hooks were not running at
 * all, the ledger is empty and every line through it reaches the stream, which
 * is the whole point of keeping a net.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS WATCHER OWES THE INGEST ENDPOINT, both of which the endpoint
 * enforces and neither of which it can enforce for us:
 *
 * - Every event is validated here, against the protocol's own schema, before it
 *   reaches the buffer. A single malformed timestamp from a transcript is
 *   enough to make `AgentEventSchema` reject the event, and the endpoint
 *   validates a BATCH — so one bad line would take up to 49 good events down
 *   with it and the 400 would emit nothing.
 * - Only one session's events are ever buffered at a time. A batch spanning two
 *   sessionIds is refused for the same reason ownership is per session, and a
 *   buffer shared across sessions would produce one by accident. Following a
 *   single current session is what keeps the accident out; the switch flushes
 *   before it reads.
