 *
 * `act()` was called with `{ args: args.join(' ') }` — every argument collapsed

 * straight to the feature, so `bounty.claim` was asked for a `bountyId` on an
 * object that had neither a `bountyId` nor any other field a real action
 * recognises. Every action invoked through the CLI failed on its input:
 *
 *     $ agent-battle bounty claim 00000000-0000-4000-8000-00000000000a
 *     bounty.claim refused its input: bounty-id-not-a-string
 *
 * and the same call with a correct body over HTTP worked, which is what made
 * this a CLI defect and not a feature one. The tests did not catch it because
 * their fake actions were written to read `input.args` — the test agreed with
 * the bug.
 *
 * ## The three accepted forms, and why there is no fourth
 *
 * `--key=value` and `--key value` for ordinary arguments; a single JSON object
 * for anything structured; and nothing else. A bare positional has no honest
 * default, because the two ways to guess it — "first argument is the id" or
 * "join them" — are both wrong for some action, and a CLI that guesses sends the
 * feature a plausible object it will refuse with a message about the wrong
 * field. Refusing here, naming the two forms, is the answer a person or an
 * agent can act on.
