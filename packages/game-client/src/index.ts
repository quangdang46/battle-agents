/**
 * The game client: the PixiJS world, M5.
 *
 * Plan section 25, and the decomposition of
 * `.tmp/age-of-agents/packages/client/src/game/` (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026
 * Mateusz Pawelczuk, recorded in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
 *
 * **Where the mirroring stops, and why that is a decision rather than drift.**
 * The reference's `view.ts` reconciles by walking every entity on every state
 * change, because its store is a whole-world snapshot. Ours takes a list of the
 * agents a delta touched, because at the event rates plan section 7.2 targets
 * (2000/s) a full walk is the entire frame budget and looks perfect in every
 * screenshot. The pixel math — `projection.ts`, the corner mask, the waypoint
 * graph, the terrain sampler, the camera guards — is mirrored and is the right
 * thing to copy. The reconcile is not, and the tests in this package are the
 * reason the difference is enforced rather than merely intended.
 *
 * The other divergence is the zone set. `TOOL_ZONE_MAP` belongs to
 * `@battle-agents/protocol` and is consumed, never restated; see `zones.ts`.
 *
 * A note on what this package does NOT do: it does not mount anything. There is
 * no `Application.init()`, no React root and no route, because DESIGN.md
 * section 3 settles the first screen as the modern Bounty Board and the Coding
 * City as a second view reached from it. A client package that mounted itself
 * would be a landing page, and that is the decision DESIGN.md exists to have
 * already made.
