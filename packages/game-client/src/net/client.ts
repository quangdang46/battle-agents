/**
 * The SSE client: `full_state` to hydrate, deltas to patch.
 *
 * Plan section 25. The wire format is already fixed and shipped — see
 * `apps/web/src/event-stream.ts` for the server half — so this file consumes a
 * decided shape rather than proposing one.
 *
 * **Reconnect is a resync, never a resume.** The hub closes a subscriber that
 * falls more than 1024 frames behind rather than skipping frames for it, and
 * the reason is written into that code: a delta stream cannot survive a gap. A
 * client that missed an event and kept going would be permanently wrong, with
 * nothing to tell it. So when the stream ends — closed by the server, dropped by
 * the network, or overflowed locally — this client stops patching and waits for
 * a fresh `full_state`. It never reconnects onto the state it already had.
 *
 * **The payload is a shape, not a promise.** Today `/api/events/stream` is an
 * unauthenticated global broadcast that subscribes the `public` view, and
 * `toPublicEvent` drops every event carrying a free-form field — which includes
 * `tool.started`, `thinking`, `file.*`, `command.run` and `prompt.submitted`. So
 * a spectator client currently receives almost nothing that moves an agent: the
 * zones it can route are the ones keyed off `test.*`, `waiting` and the session
 * lifecycle. That is a real gap and it is tracked in `ba-9hr`, not designed
 * around here. This client is built against the frame SHAPE so that when the
 * filter is finished the events flow without another change, and it says so
 * rather than pretending today's payload is the contract.
 *
 * `EventSource` is injected rather than constructed, for the same reason the
 * frame loop takes its scheduler: a client that opens its own socket cannot be
 * driven from a test, and a reconnect path that has never been executed is a
 * reconnect path that does not work.
