/**
 * The world store: normalized events in, a dirty-set out.
 *
 * Plan section 25 asks for an event-emitter store. The emitter is the small
 * half; the reason this file exists at all is the other half, which the plan
 * states as a performance clause and this file turns into a shape:
 *
 * **A delta marks the agents it touched. It does not invalidate the world.**
 *
 * A store that bumps a `version` counter on every event and lets the renderer
 * re-read everything is correct in every screenshot and costs O(scene) per
 * frame, forever. The shape here makes that mistake unrepresentable: the only
 * thing an event produces is a set of dirty agent ids, and the renderer is
 * handed that set rather than the store. So the expensive thing is not merely
 * discouraged, it has nowhere to go — the reconciler cannot see the whole scene
 * even if it wanted to.
 *
 * `applyDelta` returns what changed instead of publishing a "something
 * changed" signal, because the second is a claim a caller has to resolve by
 * diffing and the first is the diff. The emitter exists for the two things that
 * genuinely are world-wide — hydration and a dropped connection — and both of
 * those are rare by construction.
 *
 * Empty until the first `full_state`. Not "empty because nothing has happened
 * yet" — empty because a client that quietly seeds state from a fixture renders
 * beautifully and is lying, and the test that catches it is the assertion that
 * this map has no entries before the first frame.
