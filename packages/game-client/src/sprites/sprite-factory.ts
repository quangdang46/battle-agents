/**
 * The programmatic sprite factory: 16x16@3x placeholders drawn in code.
 *
 * Plan section 25: "programmatic 16x16@3x placeholders (agent-move pattern)
 * until the §14 shortlist lands". Two things about that sentence are worth
 * separating, because they are the two things a future contributor will
 * conflate.
 *
 * **16x16@3x is the PLACEHOLDER grid, not the asset grid.** The vendored
 * `tiny-swords-cc0` pack is 64px tiles in source sheets — measured, not assumed,
 * and `docs/design/asset-shortlist.md` records both the measurement and the
 * wrong "16×16" claim it replaced. A renderer built from the plan sentence alone
 * draws a 48px placeholder and a 64px real tile into the same world, and the
 * mismatch shows up as agents and buildings at subtly different scales, which is
 * the kind of bug nobody files because the screenshot looks fine. So the two
 * grids are separate constants and `TILE_SOURCE_PX` is what a real sheet is
 * scaled FROM.
 *
 * **Do not delete this file when real art lands.** The bead is explicit and the
 * reason outlives the art: it is what keeps V0 unblocked, and — the part that
 * makes the tests below possible — it is what lets the client render with no
 * asset pipeline at all. A cache that can only be exercised after a PNG fetch is
 * a cache nobody tests, and `SpriteCache` below is tested on every run.
 *
 * The CACHE is the hard requirement: two lookups of one key return the same
 * object, and the number of constructed sprites does not grow with frames
 * drawn. A fresh texture per lookup is not a cache, it is a leak with a map in
 * front of it, and it stays invisible until the frame budget goes red.
