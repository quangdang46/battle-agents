/**
 * The world renders, and is driven ONLY by normalized events.
 *
 * The failure this catches is a client that hardcodes an agent, a zone or a
 * position. It renders perfectly and violates the rule, because nothing in a
 * screenshot says where the pixel came from. So the fixture names agents the
 * client has never heard of, and the complementary assertion is that the store
 * is EMPTY before the first `full_state` — a client that quietly seeded state
 * from a fixture would pass the first test and fail the second.
