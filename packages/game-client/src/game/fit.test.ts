/**
 * The camera, proven as arithmetic rather than as pixels.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong
 *
 * Measured in a running browser against a real session: the canvas was 1230x458,
 * an idle agent's sprite sat at world pixel (864, 864), it had a valid 16x16
 * texture, `visible: true`, the right parent and the right scale — and it was
 * 400px below the bottom of the picture. `topdown(48)` maps the 32x32 grid to
 * 1536 square pixels and nothing ever scaled that to the viewport, so the middle
 * of the map was simply off-screen.
 *
 * A screenshot cannot be the assertion for this. It failed as one: a
 * headless context that has lost its drawing buffer shows the same empty canvas
 * whether the transform is right or wrong, which is how a correct fix gets
 * reverted for looking like a regression. The property here is a transform, so
 * the test is a transform.
