/**
 * The world view: the reconciliation that has to stay O(changes).
 *
 * Mirrored from age-of-agents `packages/client/src/game/view.ts` (MIT, see
 * THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) in its DECOMPOSITION — a Pixi scene with a terrain
 * layer, a unit layer, and a reconcile that maps world state onto units — and
 * deliberately not mirrored in its reconcile. The reference walks every hero and
 * every peon on every state change, because its store is a whole-world snapshot
 * it re-reads. At five units that is free; at five hundred agents receiving two
 * thousand events a second it is the entire frame budget, and it is invisible in
 * a screenshot.
 *
 * So `applyAgentDelta(ids)` here is handed the agents that changed and touches
 * exactly those. It never reads the store's size and never iterates the
 * container, and it cannot be made to: the store passes a list, not a reference.
 * The two places that genuinely must look at everything — `sweep` and
 * `rebuild` — are separate methods with names that say so, and neither is
 * reachable from a delta.
