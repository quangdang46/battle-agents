/**
 * The whole public surface of `@battle-agents/protocol`, named.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE LISTS ITS EXPORTS INSTEAD OF RE-EXPORTING THEM. This used to be
 * five `export *` lines, which works and is the thing that made the package
 * undiscoverable: a third party reading the published package — or its
 * `.d.ts`, which said the same five star-exports — could not learn what the SDK
 * offers without opening the modules behind it. For a package whose whole
 * purpose is to be consumed by strangers, "what can I import from here" is the
 * first question, and the barrel is where the answer belongs.
 *
 * The second reason is a gate. `tests/unit/out-of-tree-extension.test.ts` has to
 * decide whether an out-of-tree package's imports name something the barrels
 * actually export, and against a star-export barrel the only way to answer that
 * is to resolve `export *` transitively. That resolver had already failed
 * silently once: it tested the specifier as written, so `export * from
 * './agent-event.js'` was looked for as a file that does not exist on disk
 * (`agent-event.ts` does, and a build is what turns one into the other), every
 * branch was skipped, and the suite was green the whole time. It then missed
 * declaration-form exports as well, so it would have reported a correct import
 * as a name that does not exist. Two assertions had to be added to keep that
 * resolver honest. A flat barrel deletes the whole class of problem instead of
 * paying to supervise it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE THEREFORE COSTS. A name added to a module and forgotten here
 * is invisible to every consumer, which is the failure `export *` cannot have.
 * So the omission is asserted rather than trusted: `tests/unit/protocol-barrel.test.ts`
 * enumerates each module and fails on an export that is not re-exported, and
 * fails on a star-export creeping back in.
