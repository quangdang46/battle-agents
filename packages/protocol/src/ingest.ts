 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. It was one adapter's file — `packages/adapters/codex/src/
 * ingest.ts` — whose own comment said the duplication was deliberate "for now"
 * and named the condition that would end it: "the honest fix is one client in
 * protocol once the second adapter needs it". The second adapter is here. An
 * adapter may not import another adapter, so a copy per adapter was the only
 * alternative, and a third copy of a 150-line transport is the drift this
 * package already exists to prevent — the batching rules were lifted here for
 * exactly that reason, one bead earlier. Adapters may import this; nothing else
 * outside protocol should.
 *
 * The batching RULES stayed here too, so the client and the buffer that feeds
 * it are one contract in one package. A client that invented its own size limit
 * would be refused by the very endpoint it posts to.
 *
 * The body shape is `{ protocolVersion, events }` under a Bearer token, read off
 * apps/web/src/event-batch.ts. A client that sends a bare array is refused with a
 * 400 naming a body that must be an object.

 * one this installation owns, which is a registration problem and not something
 * a loop can talk its way out of; a 5xx leaves it genuinely unknown whether the
 * batch landed, and an event carries no id for the server to deduplicate a
 * second copy against, so retrying would trade a possible loss for a possible
 * duplicate. The honest answer to that is a caller that decides, which is the

/**
 * `POST /api/sessions` — the HELLO handshake an adapter has to make before it
 * can post anything.
 *
 * ## Why this exists here
 *
 * The ingest sender posts a batch and, until this was written, nothing else
 * existed on the client side of the handshake. So a real adapter started, read a
 * real transcript, derived a real session id from the filename, and was refused
 * with `no such session` on every batch forever — because the platform mints its
 * own session ids from the database and the two could never be the same string.
 *
 * It lives beside the ingest sender because that is the transport for "this
 * harness is talking to that platform", and the handshake is the first half of
 * that sentence. A separate `handshake.ts` would be a second place that knows
 * the base URL and the token.
 *
 * ## What it sends
 *
 * `harnessSessionRef` is the whole point. The platform keeps its own id and does
 * not let a client name a session; recording which of the HARNESS's runs this is
 * is what lets `POST /api/events` — addressed by the id in a filename — find the
 * row again. See `CreateSessionInput.harnessSessionRef`.
 *
 * ## The route is not mounted in this build
 *
 * The Next.js adapter for this call belonged to the agent feature, which was
 * removed along with every other feature package, so a live server answers 404
 * here today. The client half stayed because it is core: `packages/protocol` is
 * frozen, and deleting a client so that it stops asking a question nobody is
 * answering would be the architecture failure the layering rules exist to
 * prevent.
 *
 * What this means for a caller is stated rather than left to be discovered: an
 * adapter using `createSessionOpeningSender` will be refused at the handshake on
 * every run, and it is refused LOUDLY — `HelloRefusedError` names the status and
 * the server's own words — because a swallowed refusal is an adapter running
 * happily into a server that refuses every batch, which is the failure this
 * function was written to end. Restoring the route is an extension's job, not
 * this package's.

/**
 * An ingest sender that opens the platform run before it posts.
 *
 * ## Why this wraps the sender rather than living in a watcher
 *
 * Every adapter's watcher already emits events carrying a `sessionId`, and
 * every one of them posts through `createIngestSender`. The missing piece — the
 * HELLO handshake — was therefore added, once, here, rather than to nine
 * watchers. An adapter that emits a `sessionId` is connected; one that does not
 * is not, and there is no per-harness code to forget.
 *
 * That is also the shape the M7 promise needs to be true: "a new CLI is one
 * subdirectory" has to mean one subdirectory. With the handshake here, it does.
 *
 * ## Why it opens lazily
 *
 * A watcher does not know a session exists until it has read a line about it, so
 * a handshake taken at start-up would name a session nothing has observed yet.
 * Keying on the id found in the events means the run is opened at the moment it
 * becomes real, and each id is opened exactly once — measured, not assumed: a
 * watcher that alternates between the two most recently written transcripts
 * opened a new run on every alternation, eleven in twenty seconds, and the city
 * filled with one character standing in several places.
 *
 * ## What a refusal does
 *
 * Throws. An adapter that cannot open a run is not an adapter that is idle, and
 * the difference is the whole reason a person reads the log. A swallowed refusal
 * is an adapter running happily into a server that refuses every batch.
