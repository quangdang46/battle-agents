/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * CONTRACT 1 — the Extension API. FROZEN 2026-09-24.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything below is what a feature is written against, and every feature
 * touches nothing else in core. If a member here has to change to add a
 * feature, the contract is wrong and the change is a breaking change to every
 * extension, not a convenience.
 *
 * Two rules make that hold:
 *
 *   1. Core contains no game words. There is no XP, level, quest or bounty
 *      here, and a feature that finds itself wanting one wants its own state,
 *      not a new field on a core interface.
 *   2. Extensions are composed explicitly. `createRuntime({ extensions: [...] })`
 *      is the whole loading story. There is no plugin scanner, no remote
 *      loader and no marketplace, and adding one is out of scope on purpose.
 *
 * Per-feature state does not live in this contract. A feature keeps its own
 * state through `StateStore` under its own id, and reads other features'
 * capabilities rather than their data.
