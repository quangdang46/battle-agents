/**
 * The seam a hook-based harness plugs into.
 *
 * Ported from pixel-agents, `core/src/provider.ts` and `core/src/teamProvider.ts`
 * at commit `3537e140c209`, which plan section 28.1 item 3 classifies as a
 * direct copy. `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` carries the attribution; the upstream
 * files carry no copyright header, so there is none here to keep.
 *
 * Why this lives in core and not in an adapter: the plan makes "a new CLI is one
 * subdirectory" structural only if the seam is something an adapter can
 * implement without core knowing which adapters exist. The layering checker
 * enforces the direction, so a seam placed in an adapter would let a
 * hook-based harness and a log-watching one enter the runtime by different
 * doors, and the game core would grow two vocabularies.
 *
 * FOUR DEPARTURES from upstream, each of which would otherwise read as a typo
 * when someone diffs this against pixel-agents:
 *
 * 1. The translation target is core's `GameEvent`, not a hook-shaped event of
 *    our own. Upstream defines its own `AgentEvent` union keyed on `kind`,
 *    which is right there because their runtime is theirs. Here it would be a
 *    second event vocabulary sitting beside the frozen one, and the whole point
 *    of the seam is that a hook-based harness and a log-watching one arrive at
 *    `runtime.emit` speaking the same type. A provider that had to mint its own
 *    event shapes would be a second front door into the game.
 * 2. `installHooks` takes a target object rather than a bare url and token. The
 *    upstream signature is two positional strings, and a caller cannot tell
 *    from the call which is the server and which is the credential.
 * 3. `stop()` returns a Promise. The watcher contract this seam settles is in
 *    `lifecycle.ts`, and the reasoning is there. Upstream's AgentWatcher returns
 *    void; that shape has nowhere to await a shutdown flush, and a hook
 *    provider that has buffered a batch has exactly that to do.
 * 4. Provider ids are namespaced and validated, because two harnesses that both
 *    call themselves "code" would otherwise share one installation, one consent
 *    record and one set of hooks. The same collision problem the feature-agent
 *    identity work solves one level up; this is the lower half of it.
 *
 * Zero imports outside this package, on purpose. `packages/core/package.json`
 * has no dependencies and the layering checker reads that as structural.

/**
 * What every adapter implements, hook-based or log-watching.
 *
 * `stop` returns a Promise and that is the one deliberate difference from the
 * reference implementation, which returns void. A watcher that has buffered
 * activity — and a hook provider always buffers, because hooks arrive faster
 * than the bus drains — has a flush to await on the way down. A void `stop`
 * makes that flush fire-and-forget, and the session then ends with events
 * either dropped or delivered after the runtime has already torn down. The
 * sibling adapter beads are told to match this shape rather than the reference's.
