/**
 * The local development bypass: see the product without a GitHub OAuth app.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * Everything that needs to know who is asking resolves it through
 * `viewer-view.ts`, and standing up a real GitHub OAuth session needs a
 * registered OAuth App with an exact loopback callback. That is a legitimate
 * gate — anything naming a repository is private — but it means nothing can be
 * LOOKED AT until somebody visits github.com/settings and registers an app, and
 * a thing that cannot be seen cannot be judged.
 *
 * So: an opt-in, development-only, deliberately conspicuous way in. It changes
 * who the reader is. It does not change what any route will serve that reader,
 * so none of the boundaries `viewer-view.ts` draws move.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately is NOT
 *
 * It does not mint a session. There is no cookie, no row in Better Auth's tables
 * and nothing to log out of, because the alternative — writing a fake session —
 * creates state that outlives the flag and has to be found and cleaned up later.
 * A viewer is a render-time answer, so the bypass is a render-time answer too.
 *
 * ## Why `NODE_ENV` is the guard and not an "are we on localhost" check
 *
 * A host check asks the wrong question. A deployment behind a proxy answers to a
 * public origin and can still be someone's laptop; an origin check is satisfied
 * by whatever the `Host` header says, which an attacker on the same network can
 * set. `NODE_ENV` is set by the platform (Vercel sets `production`) and by Next
 * itself for `next start`, so it is the one signal that means "this build is the
 * one that faces users" rather than "this request claims to".
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and worth stating: the bypass does NOT work under
 * `next start`, only under `next dev`. A production build is the thing being
 * protected, and a local production build is close enough to it that the
 * distinction is not worth the risk of getting wrong.
