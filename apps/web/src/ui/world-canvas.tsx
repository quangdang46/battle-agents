/**
 * One PixiJS world, with the scene as a prop rather than a page.

 * ## Why changing scene does not reload the world
 *
 * The first version rebuilt EVERYTHING on a scene change, because the setup was
 * one effect that depended on the scene: a new `Application`, a new store, a new
 * client, and the art re-fetched. That is a page load wearing a costume, and it
 * is the thing `GameShell` exists to stop — pressing a scene should be a camera
 * move, not a navigation.
 *
 * So the three lifetimes are separated, and each is re-created only when it has
 * to be:
 *
 * - the **art** is fetched once, ever, and cached in a ref;
 * - the **application, store and client** are built once and kept in refs, which
 *   is what keeps the SSE connection and every character alive across a switch;
 * - the **view** is rebuilt per scene, because a view is where the scene lives.
 *
 * ## What is on screen came from an event
 *
 * There is no fixture and no seed in this file. The store is empty before the
 * first `full_state`, and an agent appears when a `session.started` delta lands.
 * A world that rendered a character nobody sent would be visible here as a
 * character that should not be there, which is the property the page is for.
