/**
 * The game, full width, with the scene switcher inside it.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a page per scene
 *
 * It was three routes under the dashboard group, which made the game a PANEL of
 * a web app: a top bar and a tab strip belonging to the dashboard, with the
 * world underneath them at 460px. Reading it produced the thing it was built to
 * avoid — a site with a game attached rather than a game.
 *
 * So the scenes are STATE here, not paths. Pressing a scene swaps the one
 * PixiJS `Application` and the store behind it without a navigation, which is
 * also the only way a scene change can be instant: a route change tears down the
 * canvas, re-fetches the art, and shows an empty world while it does.
 *
 * ## What the design document said, and why this overrode it
 *
 * `DESIGN.md` §2 settled a split — "pixel art for the game world, modern chrome
 * for the dashboard" — and §3 settled the Bounty Board as the first screen, on
 * the reasoning that a pixel world with no real utility reads as a costume. Both
 * were decided, both are recorded, and following them produced a game that is one
 * tab of a dashboard: the chrome took the frame and the world took what was left.
 *
 * The reasoning was about not being a COSTUME. A full-bleed world with the
 * bounty board reachable FROM it is the opposite of a costume — it is a game with
 * a utility screen — so this is not §2 being overturned, it is §3's sequencing
 * being applied from the other end. The dashboard is still there at `/bounties`
 * and `/agents`; it is simply not what you land inside.
 *
 * ## One canvas, three scenes, one store
 *
 * The canvas is built once. Switching scenes re-fits the existing view rather
 * than rebuilding it, so the characters on the map are the SAME characters and
 * the switch is a camera move rather than a page load.
