/**
 * The scene switcher, drawn as a game HUD.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a tab strip
 *
 * It was four `<button>`s in a row with a border, which is a browser tab bar
 * wearing a game's colours, and the two look the same from across a room: a
 * horizontal list of equal rectangles with text in them. Every one of those
 * properties is web. A game's navigation is not a row of equal rectangles.
 *
 * So this is a set of PLATES — distinct shapes, a distinct icon each, a distinct
 * silhouette — hung along the top-left of the screen the way a game hangs its
 * quick-travel icons, plus a number key on each. The number is the part that
 * matters: it is how you move between places in a game, and a key that does
 * something is not a tab.
 *
 * ## Why the icons differ
 *
 * Three identical circles in a row is a segmented control. The shapes and the
 * glyphs are different on purpose, so the three are told apart by silhouette
 * before they are read — which is what lets someone who cannot read the labels
 * still travel, and what makes the row read as a set of places rather than a
 * set of links.

/**
 * The three plates, and why these icons.
 *
 * The names are ones that EXIST in `kenney-game-icons` — the sheet has 105 and
 * no `sword`, no `shield` and no `city`. A first version guessed those, and a
 * guessed icon is a 404: the plate renders with a broken image in it, which is
 * the game failing at exactly the point it is trying to look finished.
 *
 * So: `home` is a place you live, `target` is a thing you aim at, `trophy` is
 * something a hall of fame is for. They are also three different shapes, which
 * is the property that makes the row readable without reading it.
