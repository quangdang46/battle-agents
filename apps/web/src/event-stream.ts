 * The realtime fan-out: an in-process hub that turns the event bus into

 *
 * Plan section 7.2 is the reason this file exists and the reason it is NOT the
 * database: Neon stores durable state, and realtime is a different job done by a
 * different layer. A spectator watching a run must see the run move — every
 * transient `tool.started`, every `thinking` — while the same events are being
 * filtered on their way to the log. Those two paths are independent and this hub
 * sits only on the realtime one.
 *
 * The stream shape is `full_state` first, `delta` after, ported from agent-move's
 * Broadcaster and the diff-broadcast shape from codemoo/agent-world (plan
 * section 28.1 item 12). Broadcast diffs, not whole state: a client that
 * rehydrates a full world model per event pays the whole model per event, and
 * 2000 events/s is exactly when that stops being affordable.
