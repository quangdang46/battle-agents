/**
 * The one runtime, the one bus, the one pool.
 *
 * This file exists because there used to be two of each. `routes.ts` built a
 * runtime for the Application API and `event-gateway.ts` built another for the
 * telemetry plane, each with its own `createInMemoryEventBus()`. The two never
 * met, so an event emitted by a game action — a quest claimed, an agent levelled,
 * a reputation changed — was published to a bus nobody was listening to, and the
 * public stream carried telemetry and nothing else.
 *
 * The gateway's own doc comment had already recorded this as a deliberate
 * deferral, and named the condition: folding the runtimes together "belongs
 * with the work that makes the act path a first-class publisher." MCP is the
 * third surface that acts, so the condition is met.
 *
 * The bus is the part that has to be shared. Two runtimes over one database is
 * a real inefficiency; two BUSES is a correctness bug, because the realtime
 * path and the action path were publishing into different rooms and each looked
 * complete from the inside.
 *
 * Composition stays in `composition.ts`. This file wires repositories to it and
 * deliberately holds no feature name, so `scripts/removal-test.sh` still has
 * exactly one place to strip a feature from.

/**
 * The singleton lives on `globalThis`, and that is load-bearing rather than a
 * style choice.
 *
 * Next.js bundles each App Router route as its OWN module graph, so a
 * module-scoped `let` is evaluated once PER ROUTE. `api/events/route.ts` and
 * `api/events/stream/route.ts` therefore each got their own copy of this file,
 * each built its own `Pool`, its own runtime and its own bus — and the whole
 * realtime layer was silently dead. Measured, not argued: a counter on the
 * module scope printed `#1 ... #2 ...` for one process, and a subscriber to
 * `/api/events/stream` received `full_state` and then nothing at all, forever,
 * while `POST /api/events` answered `200 {"accepted":1}` for events nobody
 * downstream could ever see.
 *
 * That is the failure this file was written to end — its own header calls "two
 * BUSES ... a correctness bug" — and folding the two runtimes into one file did
 * not end it, because the duplication is in the bundler and not in the imports.
 * A `globalThis` key is the one place that survives a duplicated module graph.
 *
 * The key is a Symbol rather than a string so nothing can collide with it by
 * accident, and the close handle is left on the same object so `closeSharedRuntime`
 * still releases the pool it opened.

 * The PENDING build, not the built runtime.

 * This is the second half of the bug and the half that actually bit. Caching the
 * resolved runtime is a check-then-set across an `await`: the first caller sees
 * an empty cache, starts building, and suspends at `await store.prime()` with
 * the cache still empty. The second caller arrives in that window, sees an empty
 * cache too, and builds a SECOND runtime with its own bus. Both finish, the
 * last assignment wins, and the loser keeps publishing to a bus nobody reads.
 *
 * Measured: one process, one PID, three distinct buses, `cached=false` on every
 * call. Caching the PROMISE closes it because the assignment happens
 * synchronously, before the first suspension point, so the second caller awaits
 * the build already in flight rather than starting a second one.
