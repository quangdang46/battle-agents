 * path. `createRoutes` switches on `` `${method} ${pathname}` ``, which has
 * exactly one spelling per route; a session id is a value, not a spelling.
 *
 * Three routes, and all three exist for the same reason rather than because
 * they are useful: each one reaches a registered action that names its caller,
 * and `act()` structurally cannot see the caller. `/api/act` refuses those three
 * ids outright (see `CALLER_SCOPED_ACTIONS` in `routes.ts`), so these are the
 * only way over HTTP to start a run, keep one alive, or end one — and each of
 * them fills in the identity from the credential rather than from the body.
