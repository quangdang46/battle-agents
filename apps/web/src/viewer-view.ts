/**
 * Who is looking, as far as this page is concerned.
 *
 * ## Who is looking is decided once, here
 *
 * The rule this records: anything naming a repository and an issue number is
 * private, and a page that reads the same command with no check publishes
 * exactly what a route refuses to, through a door the route does not have. So
 * the decision lives here rather than being re-made per surface.
 *
 * The bounty route this was written against is gone with its feature, and so is
 * the page group it gated. What survives is the seam: a surface that needs to
 * know who is asking resolves it through this one function rather than reading
 * the session itself, which is the property that made the boundary checkable
 * when there was something to check.
 *
 * ## The three answers, and why there are three
 *
 * `signed-out`, `auth-unconfigured` and `signed-in` look alike in a browser and
 * mean three different things to the person looking: they need to sign in, the
 * operator needs to finish `cp .env.example .env`, and everything is fine. A
 * gate that collapsed them would tell a developer their OAuth app is broken
 * when they have simply not signed in yet, and tell a signed-out visitor that
 * the platform is misconfigured.
 *
 * `readAuthEnvironment` THROWS when a variable is missing, and that is the
 * correct behaviour for a startup. On a page render it would be a 500 for
 * somebody who did nothing wrong, so it is caught here and turned into a state
 * the page can render.

   * looking at a development build with no OAuth app behind it". Folding it into
   * `signed-in` would make a screen pass its gate silently, and the one thing
   * this repository's gate exists to prevent is a screen that renders without
   * anybody having decided it should. So the state is distinct, the chrome says
   * so, and no code has to remember to check.
