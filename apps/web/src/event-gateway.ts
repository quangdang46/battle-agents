/**
 * The event gateway: the composition root for the telemetry plane.
 *
 * Plan section 7.2, as code:
 *
 *     Agents -> Next.js Event Gateway -> {Realtime -> Browser} + {important -> Neon}
 *
 * and this file is where the split is actually made. There is ONE bus, ONE hub
 * and ONE runtime, and the two downstream paths fork inside the runtime, not
 * here: `runtime.emit` persists what the persistence policy says is worth a row
 * and publishes EVERY event to the bus, and the hub is subscribed to the bus and
 * to nothing else. So the realtime path does not consult the store, and the
 * store does not consult the hub — "we do not persist it" can never quietly
 * become "we drop it", because dropping is a decision neither of them is in a
 * position to make.
 *
 * The runtime and bus arrive from `await sharedRuntime()`. This file used to build
 * its own, and the paragraph that used to sit here argued for it: folding the
 * two runtimes together "belongs with the work that makes the act path a
 * first-class publisher". MCP is that work, and the fold is done — see
 * `shared-runtime.ts` for why two buses were a correctness bug rather than an
 * inefficiency, and `tests/integration/shared-runtime-fold.test.ts` for the
 * assertion that holds them together.
