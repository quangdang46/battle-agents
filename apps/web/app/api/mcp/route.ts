/**
 * `/api/mcp` — the Next.js adapter for the MCP Streamable HTTP transport.
 *
 * Thin for the same reason the event route is: it turns a `Request` into the
 * shape the pure handler takes, and the handler's `HttpResponse` back into a
 * `Response`. Authentication, the JSON-RPC envelope, the session lifetime and
 * the `Accept` gate all live behind `sharedMcpGateway()`, where they are
 * reachable from a test without a server.
 *
 * Three verbs, because the transport needs three. POST carries the JSON-RPC.
 * GET opens the server-to-client notification stream for a session, which is
 * what an `observe` call's events travel down. DELETE ends a session. The route
 * decides none of that; it maps one to one.
 *
 * The body is passed through unserialised. The first version of this file
 * returned `JSON.stringify(response.body)`, which is right for a JSON-RPC
 * answer and silently wrong for the stream: `JSON.stringify` of a
 * `ReadableStream` is `{}`, so the GET would have returned an empty object to
 * every client that opened it. A test that only exercised POST could not see it.
 *
 * The `runtime`/`dynamic` hints keep Next.js from statically optimising a
 * long-lived stream at build time and from caching it at the edge. The GET
 * response is per-connection and never cacheable.
