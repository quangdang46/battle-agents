/**
 * `GET /api/discover`, `/api/search`, `/api/inspect` and `POST /api/act` — the
 * five primitives over HTTP, mounted.
 *
 * These were BUILT and not reachable. apps/web/src/routes.ts has been a pure
 * dispatcher over the same `createApplicationApi` the CLI and MCP consume since
 * the contract landed, but no Next.js route ever called it, so a running server
 * answered 404 to all four. That is invisible from inside the app and fatal to
 * everything outside it: packages/cli is an HTTP client now, so the CLI could not
 * reach a running instance either, and an agent had no surface to act through.
 *
 * A CATCH-ALL rather than four files, and the specific routes win: Next.js
 * prefers the more specific match, so /api/events, /api/events/stream, /api/mcp,
 * /api/auth/[...all], /api/sessions/[id]/heartbeat and /api/webhooks/github are
 * untouched by this. A test asserts that, because a catch-all that shadowed a
 * sibling would be a regression with no symptom except a 404 somewhere else.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION IS WIRED AND FAIL-CLOSED. `RouteDependencies.authenticate` is
 * optional in the type, and omitting it is how an unauthenticated /api/act
 * becomes an open door to every capability the game grows. There is no fallback
 * that permits: if the authenticator is unavailable the request is refused
 * rather than served, because "unreachable in practice" is not a property worth
 * betting a write path on — the same reasoning event-gateway.ts records.
 *
 * The credential is the Bearer installation token, which is what
 * `authenticate` in @battle-agents/db reads, and which a token in a URL is
 * REFUSED for: it would already have leaked to access logs, referrers and shell
 * history by the time a correct header arrived, so a client that does it once is
 * told so loudly rather than served.
