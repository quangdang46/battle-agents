  // DOES NOT WORK: Next.js reserves `/assets` for its own build pipeline and
  // answers every request beneath it with a 308 to the directory, so every pack
  // vendored there was unreachable from the running app. Measured — a PNG in
  // `public/assets/tiny-swords-cc0/` returned 308, and following it returned 404,
  // while a file at `public/probe.txt` beside it returned 200. The art was on
  // disk, licensed, checked, and unloadable.
  //
  // So the files live in `public/art/`, which Next serves, and this rewrite
  // keeps the URL the plan names. If the rewrite is ever reported as not
  // applying, the honest fallback is to change the URLs rather than to move the
  // files back under a reserved path.
