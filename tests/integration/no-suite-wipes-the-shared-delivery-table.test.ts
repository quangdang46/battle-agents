/**
 * The delivery ledger is a SHARED table, so a suite that wipes it is a suite
 * that can delete another suite's rows mid-run.
 *
 * ## What this exists for
 *
 * `github-webhook-end-to-end.test.ts` and `github-delivery-store.test.ts` both
 * began with `await database.delete(githubDeliveryClaims)` — the entire table —
 * and vitest runs test files in parallel workers against one database. Two
 * blanket deletes race, and the loser loses rows it wrote. The suite was
 * intermittent rather than reliably red, which is the worst shape a defect can
 * have: it looks like a flake, so it gets rerun instead of fixed.
 *
 * It was misdiagnosed twice on the way. The brief blamed a process-wide bus,
 * because the failing assertion was a length check and the file is named after
 * the bus. The real assertion was `expect(rows).toHaveLength(1)` over the whole
 * table, and the 17 it reported were sixteen `d-*` rows belonging to the other
 * suite plus its own one. A comment in the webhook file had already recorded
 * that the bus was never involved; the comment was right and was not believed.
 *
 * ## Why a comment was not enough
 *
 * Both files now scope their cleanup, and both say why in prose. Prose is a
 * claim. This is the check, and it fails if a suite adds an unscoped delete back
 * — which is the change most likely to be made by someone who has no reason to
 * read either comment, and who will find the blanket delete waiting for them in
 * a dozen other fixtures.
 *
 * ## Deliberately narrow
 *
 * It checks THIS table, not "test isolation" in general. A general check here
 * would pass or fail on things this defect has nothing to do with, and would
 * eventually be disabled when it went red for an unrelated reason — which is how
 * the schema-hygiene gate died twice.
