/**
 * The fresh-agent conformance test.
 *
 * ── What it actually is ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A client whose ENTIRE protocol vocabulary is parsed out of the four published
 * documents, driving a real server over the real routes, against a real
 * Postgres. It is not an LLM, and it is not a demonstration: the thing under
 * test is the claim that the documents are sufficient for a third party with no
 * repository access. Sufficiency has one falsifiable form — a client that knows
 * nothing except what the documents say, and either completes the loop or does
 * not.
 *
 * The rule that makes it a test rather than a demo is stated in the type
 * `DocumentedAgent`: it is constructed from four strings and from a transport,
 * and it holds no protocol constant of its own. Every action id, every input
 * field name, every event type, every batching number, every endpoint path and
 * the protocol version are read out of the documents. If a document drops a
 * step, renames a field, or names something the server does not have, the agent
 * either cannot find it or sends the wrong thing, and this test fails.
 *
 * ── What the loop proves, step by step ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   HELLO      the character is resolved from (owner, name) and a run is opened
 *   telemetry  a batch built to the documented shape is accepted, and the
 *              documented split between persisted and transient holds
 *   observe    a live frame arrives and the agent reads it
 *   heartbeat  the documented route answers for a run that owns itself
 *   act        an action the document names runs, and battle weights are public
 *   end        the run closes and the character is still there
 *
 * ── What it cannot prove, and must not be read as proving ───────────────────
 *
 * It does not prove the documents are CLEAR. A client that parses a table can
 * work perfectly well on prose a person would find ambiguous. The bead says this
 * outright: the test's job is to catch the documents being WRONG.
 *
 * It also does not prove the documents are OPEN-ENDED. A scripted client uses
 * the steps the documents give it; the claim being tested is that those steps
 * are sufficient for one full loop, not that they are the only loop possible.
 *
 * ── The mutations, and why they are in the file ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The last describe block damages the documents on disk — in memory, through
 * the same reader — and asserts the loop stops working. A conformance test
 * that has only ever been seen green proves that a loop can be completed by
 * someone who already knows the answer. These are what make it a check.
