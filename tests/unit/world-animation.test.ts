/**
 * Characters move.
 *
 * ## What was actually shipped
 *
 * The vendored sheets ship three animations per hero — `idle` (4 frames),
 * `walk` (6) and `work` (9) — and none of them was ever played. `SpriteCache.get`
 * returned one texture per agent, chosen once, and the view assigned it once.
 * The city was nineteen identical figures standing still, which is a diagram of
 * a game rather than a game.
 *
 * The first version of the fix put the advance inside `render`, which was wrong
 * in a way worth recording. `FrameLoop.frame()` returns early when nothing
 * changed:
 *
 *     if (this.#pending.size === 0) return { rendered: 0, resynced: false };
 *
 * and an agent spends most of its life not changing anything — reading a file
 * emits one event and then nothing for minutes. So animating on deltas froze the
 * characters for exactly the stretches where a player is watching them wait.
 * `animate` is a separate call on every frame for that reason, and the test
 * below drives it with a clock rather than by pushing events.
