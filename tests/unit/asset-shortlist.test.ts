/**
 * The asset shortlist, and the licenses that back it.
 *
 * ## Why the license is checked against the SHIPPED file
 *
 * The failure this guards is the one where a pack is relicensed upstream between
 * selection and merge. The shortlist still says CC0, a `LICENSE.txt` still
 * exists, and a check that only asks "does a license file exist?" passes while
 * the repository asserts something untrue. So the recorded license is compared
 * against the text actually shipped beside the pack.
 *
 * ## Why no style check exists here
 *
 * The plan makes style consistency the selection criterion, and it would be easy
 * to write a check that greps the shortlist for the word "pixel" and calls that
 * a style gate. It would be worthless: no script can judge whether five packs
 * look like one game, and a check that claims to would be the exact failure this
 * repository keeps meeting — a guard that returns nothing and is trusted anyway.
 * The style claim is a declared column, reviewed by a human, and the
 * `SHORTLIST.md` section on what is and is not true is the artifact of that
 * judgment.
