/**
 * The shared adapter contract suite.
 *
 * Two beads reported independently that the suite their briefs name does not
 * exist, and both were right: the only trace of it was a comment in tool-map.ts
 * claiming it "asserts against the map directly", which was false. A gate that
 * exists in a comment is the failure this repository keeps paying for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT ASSERT, because a suite that claims more than it
 * checks is the same defect. It cannot assert per-harness event coverage:
 * packages/adapters/_template declares REQUIRED_EVENT_TYPES as
 * session.started, session.ended, tool.started and tool.completed, and the
 * already-shipped adapters do not all meet it — Cursor writes no tool result
 * anywhere in its format, so a tool.completed would assert an outcome the file
 * does not contain. Asserting the template's list would be red on day one, and a
 * permanently red suite is switched off, which is worse than a narrow one.
 *
 * So it asserts the three properties that are true of every adapter by
 * construction, and that are each a real way to drift:
 *
 *   1. SHAPE — every adapter's watcher satisfies the same AgentWatcher contract,
 *      so a surface that watches one can watch any.
 *   2. VOCABULARY — every event an adapter emits validates against the frozen
 *      zod union. An adapter inventing an event is refused at the door with a
 *      400, and finding that out from a live server is a debugging session.
 *   3. THE TOOL MAP IS SHARED — an adapter that grows its own tool-name table
 *      is the two-copies-drift failure again, at the layer where drift is
 *      hardest to notice, because each copy is individually correct.
 *
 * The per-harness event lists belong beside each adapter's own fixtures, which
 * is where that evidence already is.

 * contract, this map stops compiling. That is the property a signature change
 * can silently undo, and it is why `stop` returning `Promise<void>` is checked
 * rather than merely documented — a `void` stop compiles everywhere and flushes
