/**
 * The renderer draws the vendored art, not rectangles.
 *
 * ## What was actually shipped
 *
 * `apps/web/public/art/` held 3,436 files — 2,981 PNGs across ten CC0 packs,
 * plus the `age-of-agents` fantasy and scifi sheets this file is about. Every one
 * of them was referenced from a comment and from nothing else. `SpriteCache.get`
 * called `drawSprite`, which builds a `PixelCanvas` and fills two rectangles, so
 * the Coding City was a grid of grey boxes drawn at runtime while a licensed,
 * attributed, downloaded art pack sat next to it unread.
 *
 * The file that drew the rectangles said exactly what would happen:
 *
 * > A placeholder that tries to be a character illustration is a placeholder
 * > nobody can distinguish from real art, and the moment real art lands the
 * > difference has to be obvious or the placeholders quietly ship.
 *
 * They shipped. That sentence is the reason these tests exist rather than a
 * description of them.
 *
 * ## Why the cache is the seam
 *
 * `PixiWorldView` asks for `spriteKey(kind, variant)` and gets a `Texture`. It
 * has no idea where a texture came from. Attaching art to the CACHE rather than
 * branching in the view is what keeps the O(1) cache property, keeps the view
 * free of a fetch, and keeps the programmatic factory as the answer for a build
 * that never loads anything.
